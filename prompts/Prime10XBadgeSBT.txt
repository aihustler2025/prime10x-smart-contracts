🛠️ SMART CONTRACT PROMPT #1 — BADGE SBT
This is the prompt you will paste directly into ChatGPT Codex to generate the contract code.
I will also provide a simple human explanation after the prompt.

🚀 COPY/PASTE THIS INTO CODEX
(Smart Contract Prompt #1 — Badge SBT)

You are ChatGPT Codex. Generate a complete, production-grade Solidity smart contract for a Prime10X Badge SBT (Soulbound Token) system deployed on the Base network.

============================================================
PROJECT CONTEXT (READ CAREFULLY)
============================================================
Prime10X has an off-chain SocialFi system. Users earn ranks based on shard accumulation. After each season, eligible users will receive a non-transferable Badge SBT as a symbolic achievement.

IMPORTANT:
- The blockchain contract DOES NOT calculate rank.
- The blockchain contract DOES NOT interact with shards, minerals, raffles, or quests.
- All rank logic happens off-chain.
- The backend admin will mint SBTs manually or by script AFTER TGE.

Your job:
Create a contract that supports minting and revoking non-transferable badges to user wallets.

============================================================
BADGE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
============================================================

There are SIX badge types for Season 1:
0 = Prospector
1 = Surveyor
2 = Extractor
3 = Refiner
4 = PrimeOperator
5 = Ascendant

Each wallet can hold ONLY ONE badge per season.

Minting rules:
- Only the contract owner (admin) may mint badges.
- Minting requires specifying:
  - wallet address
  - badge type (0–5)
  - season ID (uint256)
- Badge must be SOULBOUND (non-transferable, non-approvable).

Metadata:
- Use ERC721-style metadata (tokenURI).
- TokenURI is generated by concatenating:
  “https://prime10x.com/badges/season/{season}/{badgeType}.json”
- No on-chain SVG required.

Non-transferability rules:
- Override transfer functions to ALWAYS revert.
- Override setApprovalForAll and approve to ALWAYS revert.

Revocation:
- Admin must have the ability to revoke a badge (burn it).

Events:
- BadgeMinted(address indexed to, uint256 tokenId, uint256 season, uint256 badgeType)
- BadgeRevoked(address indexed from, uint256 tokenId)

Access Control:
- Use OpenZeppelin Ownable for admin permissions.

Chain:
- Must compile on Solidity ^0.8.20
- Compatible with Base network.

============================================================
CONTRACT STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS
============================================================
Contract name: Prime10XBadgeSBT

Include:
- ERC721
- Ownable
- Soulbound rules

Store:
- mapping(address => mapping(uint256 season => uint256 tokenId))
- mapping(tokenId => uint256 badgeType)
- mapping(tokenId => uint256 season)

Functions:
- mintBadge(address to, uint256 season, uint256 badgeType)
    - ensures wallet does not already have a badge for that season
- revokeBadge(uint256 tokenId)
- tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) override
- disable all transfer/approval functions
- totalSupply() optional
- walletOf(address user, season) view returns tokenId

============================================================
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS
============================================================
- Ensure safeMint pattern
- Use Counters for token IDs
- Ensure badge types outside 0–5 revert
- Ensure season ID cannot be zero
- Gas-optimized where practical
- Include comments for readability

============================================================
BEGIN OUTPUT NOW.
Generate full Solidity code only.

🧩 HUMAN EXPLANATION (Simple Terms)
This contract does:
✔ Issue “achievement badges” as NFTs
They represent a user’s final rank at end of season


Minted AFTER you evaluate rank off-chain


Stored on Base forever


✔ They are SBTs (Soulbound Tokens)
Cannot be transferred


Cannot be sold


Cannot be approved


Only admin can mint or revoke


✔ Supports multiple seasons
Season 1, Season 2, etc.


A user gets one badge per season


✔ Uses URLs for metadata
You will later upload JSON files like:
https://prime10x.com/badges/season/1/5.json

✔ Very safe & clean
No crazy features.
 Just badge minting + revocation + metadata URI.

🟩 NEXT STEPS
After you generate the code in Codex:
You send the code here.


I review it.


I fix errors, optimize, and finalize it.


Then you say:
 “Proceed to Smart Contract Prompt #2 — Voucher NFT.”


Ready when you are.
